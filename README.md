# DeepMind Educational Resources

This repository contains a collection of educational resources that we have
prepared for teaching the basics of machine learning to younger audiences. The
goal is to have simple and accessible resources that can enable anyone with no
machine learning background to engage and learn from these tutorials.

Our aim is to contribute to democratisation of machine learning by providing
accessible educational resources to inspire younger generations.

## Tutorials

These tutorials are presented as notebooks that can be launched via
Google Colab.

### Protein Folding  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/educational/blob/master/colabs/protein_folding.ipynb)

This tutorial explores the use of machine learning for solving the protein
structure prediction problem. Although the tutorial does not actually solve the
problem itself, it provides students with very basic background in coding
and biology to get started, and trains their intuition on machine learning
methods, with the help of visualisation and a few examples of folding simple
protein structures.

### Basics of Reinforcement Learning [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/educational/blob/master/colabs/reinforcement_learning.ipynb)


This tutorial introduces students to a simple reinforcement learning (RL) setup
used in research. It involves running pre-existing code to set up an RL
environment and visualise it. Students can then look at how a completely random
(untrained) agent behaves in these environments. We also include simple code
that implements a reinforcement learning method that can train the agent to
solve these simple tasks. The behaviour of the trained agent can be then
visualised together with plots of how the agent evolves through training.
